## Project list

### BGG recommender
This is a simple yet elegant recommender model based on what similar users have rated.
For example, if you liked x, what would other users that have liked x recommend?
This model is designed to provide recommendations for board games, taken from the Board Game Geek website (like IMDB but for board games).
More details on the model, it's capabilities and other useful links can be found at the streamlit project page: [Link](https://bgg-recommender.streamlit.app)
