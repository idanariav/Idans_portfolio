This repository includes several key projects written during my former occupation as a data analyst 
or as part of a personal independent project.
The following explanations are per code.

# File - avodata_project.R

This code is written in R, and demonstrates the steps and methods used to create the database for the Avodata project.
Avodata is a public website that presents several characteristics, mainly wage, for different occupations and education levels, 
thereby assists individuals to decide which career or education path to pursue. 
The project involves merging and modifying data from different sources using R, 
for instance income data from the ITA (Israel Tax Authority), demographic data from the CBS (Central Bureau of Statistics) 
and education data from the CHE (Council for Higher Education).

The code was used at the CBS research room, which includes limited availability of R/Rstudio updates and R packages. (R version - 3.6).
This limitation forced me to create workarounds when relevant packages/functions were missing.

# File - Labor_monthly_analysis
As part of my former occupation as a data analyst for the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs,
I used to create monthly analysis of Israel's Labor market such as Employment/Unemployed rate by different communities
such as Arabs, non-orthodox jews, etc. based on the monthly CBS surveys.

The code was used at the CBS research room, which includes limited availability of R/Rstudio updates and R packages. (R version - 3.6).
This limitation forced me to create workarounds when relevant packages/functions were missing.

# File - R basics
This code is a useful toolbox which includes basic and advanced R tips for various aspects of coding such as data cleaning, 
merging, visualisation, etc. It agreggates most of the things I learned the hard way, mostly through extensive searches in Stack Overflow,
so that you wont have to.
I see it a complementry tool similar to exisiting cheatsheets to formal training or as a go-to guide while on the job.
