This code is written in R, and demonstrates the steps and methods used to create the database for the Avodata project.
Avodata is a public website that presents several characteristics, mainly wage, for different occupations and education levels, 
thereby assists individuals to decide which career or education path to pursue. 
The project involves merging and modifying data from different sources using R, 
for instance income data from the ITA (Israel Tax Authority), demographic data from the CBS (central bureau of statistics) 
and education data from the CHE (Council for Higher Education).

The code was used at the CBS research room, which includes limited availability of R/Rstudio updates and R packages. (R version - 3.6).
This limitation forced me to create workarounds when relevant packages were missing.
