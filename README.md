# Project Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my Github page.
This folder includes a collections of side project made throughout the recent years,
inspired by the challenges and questions a data analyst faces, and aspirations to
learn more about the field of data science.

The portfolio is divided into 3 main sections:

1. Python - My most recent projects and the more complicated ones have been written in python. 
Feel free to explore the python folder to view projects ranging from data analysis to ML models and web scrapping.
Some have also been published in Kaggle and Streamlit.

2. Tableau - visualizations created in Tableau as part of the #Makeovermonday project. 
They are all avilable on my public Tableau website which can be found [Here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/idan.ariav).

2. R - This is a small example of scripts written during my first job as a data analyst.
While they might not be "external viewer friendly", I do believe they demonstrate my capabilities
with utilizing this language.
